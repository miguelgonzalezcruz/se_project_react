# WTWR | What to Wear

## About

The idea of the application is pretty smart - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. How cool, isn't it?

This application will read weather data from a Weather API and then recommend suitable clothing to the user based on that data.

In this project we practice the principles of React.
